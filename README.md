# Purpose
Eusync aims to create a centralised route planning and booking system with available white-label end-points that allows convenient information
gathering and booking of railway tickets for domestic and international providers. Eusync replaces virtually the entire tech stack of the providers, except for the underlying timetabling, and therefore reduces development costs to next to zero, whilst also allowing for much higher resource efficiency due to the structure of Eusync compared to what's on the market. Eusync is designed to be easily expandable but initially only support selected railway
companies and their booking capabilities, which then allows for an easy expansion revolving around a sort of epicentre.
