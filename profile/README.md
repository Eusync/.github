# Purpose
Eusync aims to create a centralised route planning and booking system with available white-label end-points that allows convenient information
gathering and booking of railway tickets for domestic and international providers. Eusync replaces virtually the entire tech stack of the providers, except for the underlying timetabling, and therefore reduces development costs to next to zero, whilst also allowing for much higher resource efficiency due to the structure of Eusync compared to what's on the market. Eusync is designed to be easily expandable but initially only support selected railway
companies and their booking capabilities, which then allows for an easy expansion revolving around a sort of epicentre.

# Projects
### IntegRail
IntegRail serves as the core of Eusync. It serves as the actual centralization aspect of the project.
Due to IntegRail's architectural contrast to the currently used systems, Eusync allows for tremendous increases in efficiency and ressource-lightness. This results in tremendous boosts in performance for both providers and customers, as queries now take bare milliseconds instead of seconds.
Furthermore, due to the architecture IntegRail is built with, full coverage of any routes with realtime data is supported. This means that customers are informed about any changes or news to their bookings at lightning speeds.

### TripTrain
TripTrain serves as the primary endpoint application for IntegRail and provides a consumer frontend in the form of a whitelabel solution, branded with each respective railway provider's designs. TripTrain provides an entire consumer frontend to businesses, allowing the customers to utilise planning and booking features provided by IntegRail. Furthermore, dynamic route visualisation is possible with TripTrain, a feature that hasn't been established at all in the industry as of now.
